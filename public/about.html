<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student with a passion for building meaningful tech solutions that improve communication and simplify everyday interactions. My interests lie in web development, project coordination, and human-focused technologies. I recently completed LingoBridge, a real-time translation chat application that integrates speech-to-text, automatic translation, and text-to-speech features using tools like ReactJS, Flask, Firebase, Google Translate API, and Whisper. I enjoy working across both frontend and backend, and I’m also exploring areas like machine learning and automation through hands-on projects. With a strong foundation in development and a growing interest in team coordination and HR tech, I’m always excited to learn, create, and contribute to innovative projects.
